# RemoteDoorLock

RemoteDoorLock is designed to be able to unlock and lock a door remotely using a 3D printed gear system on a deadbolt lock. Using an Arduino R4, we will create a service that can remotely connect to a computer using Bluetooth or Wifi. There will be a password system in place as a security function. Refer to webserv.cpp for code regarding connection functionality.

Use the command: "chmod +x <file_name>" to make cgi scripts executable.
The usage for connecting to a port is either <ip_address>:<port_number> or <port_number
  The usage <port_number> connects to the port using localhost

No implementation of Advanced Features

RemoteDoorLock is a project for our class CS410 in Boston University
